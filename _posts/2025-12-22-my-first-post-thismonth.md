1. I created a GitHub account
2. I forked a repository from https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/tree/master
3. I renamed the forked repository synchrodig.github.io
4. I edited the files as described in the README.md
5. Now I am writing my first post by following the advice that I got from the README file.
